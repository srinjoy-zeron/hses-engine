# HSES Project: The Human Security Exploitability System
## Quantifying the Human Factor in Cybersecurity

---

### [Hero Section]
**Headline**: Security isn't just about Firewalls. It's about Physiology.
**Sub-headline**: The world’s first research-driven engine that calculates real-time "Human Exploitability Scores" by analyzing physiological signals, behavioral patterns, and environmental context.

### [The Problem]
**The Invisible Risk**
Cybersecurity tools defend networks, endpoints, and clouds, but they ignore the most critical attack surface: **The Human**.
*   **74%** of breaches involve the human element (Verizon DBIR).
*   Stress, fatigue, and distraction make even the best-trained analysts vulnerable to social engineering.
*   Security teams currently have **zero visibility** into the real-time cognitive state of their workforce.

### [The Solution]
**HSES: Real-Time Human Risk Intelligence**
The Human Security Exploitability System (HSES) bridges the gap between biology and security. By ingesting real-time physiological data and contextual metadata, HSES quantifies how "exploitable" a user is at any given second.

> "A fatigued admin at 3 AM is 10x more likely to click a phishing link than a focused analyst at 10 AM. HSES proves it."

### [How It Works]
**The 7-Step Scoring Pipeline**

1.  **Ingest Signals**: We collect non-invasive signals like heart rate, typing speed, jitter, and screen focus time.
2.  **State Analysis**: Our engine maps these signals to cognitive states: *Stress, Fatigue, Focus, or Confusion*.
3.  **Contextual Multipliers**: We adjust for environmental factors—Time of Day, Session Length, and Background Noise.
4.  **Risk Calculation**: The engine computes a raw "Exploitability Score" (0-100).
5.  **Scenario Prediction**: High scores trigger specific vulnerability warnings (e.g., *"High Vulnerability to BEC"*).

### [Key Features]

#### 🧠 **Physiological Signal Normalization**
Raw data is messy. HSES normalizes diverse inputs (pulse, keystroke dynamics) into a unified risk metric, making biological data actionable for security logic.

#### 📊 **The Signal Equalizer**
Visualize the invisible. Our "Signal Equalizer" dashboard breaks down risk contributors in real-time, showing exactly which factor (e.g., "High Stress") is spiking the risk score.

#### 🛡️ **Role-Based Exploit Modifiers**
Not all users are equal. HSES dynamically adjusts risk tolerance based on user privileges (Admin vs. User) and data access levels.

#### ⚡ **SecOps-Ready API**
Built on FastAPI, the HSES engine provides low-latency risk scores that can be integrated directly into SIEMs, SOARs, or Zero Trust policy engines.

### [Use Cases]
*   **Dynamic Access Control**: Prompt for MFA if a user's Fatigue score is > 80.
*   **Targeted Training**: trigger micro-trainings only when a user is in a "Teachable Moment" (High Focus, Low Stress).
*   **SOC Analyst Monitoring**: Prevent burnout by monitoring the cognitive load of security teams in real-time.
