# Welcome to the HSES Wiki

Welcome to the documentation for the **Human Exploitability System (HES)**, a project by the **Zeron Research Team**.

## Navigation

- [**Architecture Overview**](Architecture.md): Understand the high-level design and data flow of the system.
- [**Models & Logic**](Models.md): Deep dive into the scoring algorithms, signal normalization, and state determination logic.
- [**API Reference**](API.md): Technical details on the backend endpoints and data schemas.

## Project Vision

The goal of this project is to model human risk in real-time, moving beyond static training to dynamic, signal-based assessment. By understanding the physiological and behavioral state of a user, we can better predict and prevent social engineering attacks.
